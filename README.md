# The Dangers of Journalism: Death on Assignment
## Analyzing the killings of journalists around the world
### By Amanda Ramirez

Journalism can be a dangerous job. To some, a free press be intimidating and journalists are seen as targets to violence. Even if the violence is not direct, pursing an assignment can also pose safety risks.  For this project, I was wondering about the circumstances of fallen journalists around the world. Some of the questions I asked were: Where and how did it happen? To whom? Is it common?
